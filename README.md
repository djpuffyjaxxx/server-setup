# General



At Gray Alien Ventures, a lot of our projects involve a React frontend with a WordPress backend, or sometimes even just a WordPress site. Using WordPress in this way provides us out-of-the-box functionality for authentication, user management, API endpoints, and so forth, while still maintaining the upsides of using React for the frontend website and/or app.

  

# Hosting

  

A **Virtual Private Server**, or **VPS**, is the machine that hosts your code. It is a low-cost alternative to managing a **dedicated server** and is used in most web and mobile app development.

  

We use [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/8b231954196d) for most of our projects.

  

When [creating a new Droplet](https://m.do.co/c/8b231954196d), select the latest LTS distribution of Ubuntu.

Then, select whichever CPU options and Droplet plan is right for your project. Because the bulk of our contracts are with early stage companies seeking to develop a **Minimum Viable Product**, or **MVP**, our resource requirements are low enough that the Regular Intel CPU with SSD option for $5.00 per month suffices.

After this, select a data center closest to where you anticipate most of your traffic to come from, create a password, choose a hostname that is similar or the same to your projectâ€™s name, and click `Create Droplet`. If you know how to use SSH keys, then use this option instead of using a password, but this should be obvious to those that do.

  

# Domain Name

  

Now that you have your host setup, you will most likely need a **domain name**, unless you wish to tell people your IP address each time. *You do not.*

  

[NameCheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/qnmagq) is where we purchase our domain names.
